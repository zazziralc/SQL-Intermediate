/*
Explaining Window Functions 

Window functions are very useful for analysis.  Examples include rolling totals, moving averages and ranking per category.
A window function is a computation that returns a single value applied to a set of rows defined by a window specification.
Each column can independently calculate a window function.
Each row has its own window

Syntax: window_function(...) OVER (window specification)

We use a small table, PatientStay,  in these examples.
